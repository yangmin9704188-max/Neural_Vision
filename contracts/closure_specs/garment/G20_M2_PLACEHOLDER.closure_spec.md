# G20_M2_PLACEHOLDER Closure Spec

- module: garment
- step_id: G20_M2_PLACEHOLDER
- m_level: M2
- validation_report: `reports/validation/garment/G20_M2_PLACEHOLDER.validation_report.md`

## Closure Criteria
- Step is explicitly marked as placeholder/deferred in master plan.
- Dependency `G10_M1_PUBLISH` is already satisfied.
- Placeholder is documented with no disruptive M2 implementation required.

## Closure Decision
- status: CLOSED
- rationale: roadmap placeholder condition is met and traceably documented.
